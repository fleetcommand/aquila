Aquila DC Hub Installation manual

This software is covered by the GPL.

Just do 
	./configure
	make
	make install

Then create a directory to run aquila in.
In that directory, run the following command

	aqpasswd accounts.conf <owner> <passwd>

Replace <owner> with the nick of the hub owner and <passwd> with his
password. Then start the hub.

By default, the hub starts at port 411. If you do not wish to run Aquila as
root, you can make the hub start port <port> by creating the file
hub.conf with contents:

nmdc.listenport <port>

Then start Aquila. Log into the hub as owner and type "!save". This should
create all configuration files. All configuration can (and should) be
changed from within the hub.
