Aquila is a Direct Connect Hub.

A Direct Connect (DC) Hub allows connected clients to download and search the
shared files of the other users on the hub and it allows those users to chat
with eachother.

This project is a research project into high performance serving of a large
number of clients. The target is to serve as much users as possible with low 
delays and low resource usage. 

The nature of the DC protocol makes it an ideal candidate for this project.
The traffic send by a hub rises exponentially with the number of users, this
creates large amounts of traffic to send and requires special precautions to
do this efficiently.

I would like to point out that the user is fully responsible for the use of
this software.
